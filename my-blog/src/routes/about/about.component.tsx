      <p>
        Hi, I'm John - a lifelong learner with a passion for science and
        technology. My early career as an EMT, Paramedic, and Firefighter
        Paramedic was driven by my love of science and the human body. But as I
        continued to explore the world of tech and programming, I found myself
        captivated by the endless possibilities for innovation and
        problem-solving. While I enjoyed the fast paced and hands-on work of
        emergency medicine, my true passion for tech was sparked by my
        introduction to coding. Now, as a software engineer, I bring a unique
        blend of analytical thinking and scientific curiosity to every project I
        work on.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a self-taught developer, I have embraced the challenges and rewards
        of learning code through trial and error and hands-on experience. With a
        strong focus on front-end development, I am constantly pushing myself to
        learn new skills and explore new technologies. Currently I am working on
        mastering React.js while also refining my knowledge of back-end
        development. My goal is to become a full-stack developer and bring my
        expertise to a dynamic team that values innovation and creativity.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I continue to grow and develop my skills as a software engineer, I am
        excited to bring my diverse background and strong work ethic to the tech
        industry. With my unique combination of medical expertise and technical
        skills, I am confident that I would be a valuable asset to any business
        looking for a passionate, knowledgeable, and adaptable team member.
